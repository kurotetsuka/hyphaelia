## dttpd :: dttp daemon

Dependencies:  
 - rust nightly build
 - cargo nightly build

On most systems you can install both rust and cargo in one step:
```bash
curl -sS https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo bash
```

Alternatively, on an arch-based distro install the `rust-nightly-bin` and `cargo-nightly-bin` aur packages. On manjaro, you can do so with the following:
```bash
yaourt -Sa cargo-nightly-bin
```
